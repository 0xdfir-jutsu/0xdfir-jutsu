## What's up!

At the age of 13, I created my first ever computer virus on a Windows XP and since then have been obsessed with to Security Research and Software Development. I am currently working on getting my OSCP and Pentest+ to be an expert in the field on Information Security and pen-testing. On this github I have a lot of repositories ranging from my personnal work to my portfolio projects and School Projects.
